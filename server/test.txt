1) What is the role of Indian culture and tradition when we say Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam?

Ans: Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is a sankrit phase found in Hindu texts such as the Maha Upanishad, which means "The world is one family". The idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is India's contribution to world peace and it is based on the prayers "Lok Samasta Sukhino Bhavanta" Meaning, let the entire world be happy. 

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam has been the guiding light for the Indian family system since time and our ethics and socio - cultural fabric are woven around this perceptiion. We Indians have always helped the world to come together as one family. Recently as India celebrated Azadi ka Amrit Mohotsava, to we commemorated 75 years of
Independence and the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (world is one o family) was appreciated. 

This is one of the core philosophy of Indian civilization since ancient times. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam has always been the guiding light for Indian family system. The entire world is indebted to mothers, she is the bond that holds the family together. We Indians have always belived that all people, the world as one family and to we had always loved each and every person living in this world. 

We also believe that peace and harmony will bring us all together. Our Indian culture has always welcomed people from all over the world in our country with love breaking the barriers of country, religion, etc. As a citzen of our country we must protect India's heritage and culture. 

Our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi used this phase in a speech at World Culture Festival, Organized by Art of Living, adding that "Indian culture is very rich and it is there in each one of us with great values. We are the people who have come from Aham Brahmasmi to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
